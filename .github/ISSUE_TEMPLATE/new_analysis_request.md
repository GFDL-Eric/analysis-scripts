**Describe the science question your POD addresses**

**Describe the analysis your analysis suite will perform**
[e.g., my analysis suite computes the 3-month average of wind speed over DJF,MAM, JJA, SON from 1970--2020]

**What output does your analysis suite generate?**
[e.g., my analysis suite produces a 4-panel figure of seasonal composite maps of 850-hPa wind speed ]

**Describe any required observational input files**
[e.g., this analysis suite requires monthly u and v wind components from the NNR Reanalysis II dataset over 1970--2020]

**Describe any required model input files**
[e.g., this analysis suite requires daily wind speed from the CMIP6.DAMIP.NOAA-GFDL.GFDL-CM4.hist-nat.r2i1p1f1 dataset over 1998--2010]
